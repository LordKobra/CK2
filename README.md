# CK2
error logs, saves, mods etc. for Crusader Kings II

**Cobra's Event logger V2.2** 

You can add/remove debug info to the decisions and events of your mod. Check the [release section](https://github.com/LordKobra/CK2/releases/tag/Release) or compile the source code (e.g. with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)) and place it in the same directory where your mod's 'events' and 'decisions' folders are located.
